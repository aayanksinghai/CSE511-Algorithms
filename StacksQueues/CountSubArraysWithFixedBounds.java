/*
 * You are given an integer array nums and two integers minK and maxK.
A fixed-bound subarray of nums is a subarray that satisfies the following conditions:
The minimum value in the subarray is equal to minK.
The maximum value in the subarray is equal to maxK.
Return the number of fixed-bound subarrays.
A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.
